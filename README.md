# OptiStack Supplement & Medication Manager

**Stop managing your health in spreadsheets.** 

OptiStack is a professional-grade, self-hosted platform designed for biohackers and health optimizers. It brings order to complex protocols with **AI-powered interaction analysis**, smart inventory tracking, precise timing schedules, and doctor-ready PDF reports. 

Whether you're taking a daily multivitamin or managing a complex longevity protocol, OptiStack handles the cognitive load—tracking dosages, checking for contraindications, and helping you stay consistent—all in a privacy-first, Docker-deployable package.

## Why I Built This

As someone interested in biohacking and optimizing my own biology, my supplement stack eventually grew from a daily multivitamin into a complex protocol of specific compounds, timings, and cycling schedules. I found myself juggling messy spreadsheets, mental checklists, and random notes just to keep track of it all.

I built OptiStack to help with this. I wanted something that felt personal and handled the "cognitive load" of self-optimization—tracking inventory, checking for negative interactions, and helping me stay consistent. This project is my solution for bringing order to the chaos of managing a serious health protocol. I hope you find it useful!

> **Disclaimer: As with any biohacking tool, use at your own risk. I am not a doctor and this tool should not be used as a substitute for medical advice. Always consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new health protocol. Recognize that AI is not a substitute for medical advice and should not be used as a substitute for medical advice. AI can make mistakes and always double-check any recommendations with a healthcare professional or your own research.**

## Quick Start

### Option A: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

Run OptiStack directly from GitHub Container Registry — no clone required:

```bash
# Download the production compose file and example environment
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylermiranda/OptiStack/main/docker-compose.production.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tylermiranda/OptiStack/main/.env.example

# Create your .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings (see Required Secrets below)

# Run OptiStack
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

---

### Option B: Clone and Build Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tylermiranda/OptiStack.git
cd OptiStack
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
docker compose up -d
```

---

### Configuration

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

**Recommended secrets** — If not provided, random secrets will be generated at startup (invalidating sessions on restart, requiring re-login):
```bash
# Run this command twice, once for each secret
openssl rand -base64 48
```

- `JWT_SECRET` — Signs authentication tokens.
- `SESSION_SECRET` — Signs session cookies.

**Admin user** — Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` for the default admin account (username defaults to `admin`).

### Login

On first startup, a default admin user is created:
- **Username:** `admin` (or value of `ADMIN_USERNAME`)
- **Password:** The value you set for `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | ⚠️ | Auto-generated | Secret for tokens. Set manually for persistent sessions. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | ⚠️ | Auto-generated | Secret for cookies. Set manually for persistent sessions. |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | ✅* | - | Password for default admin user |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` | ❌ | `admin` | Username for default admin user |
| `AI_PROVIDER` | ❌ | `openrouter` | AI provider: `openrouter` (cloud) or `ollama` (local) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | ❌ | - | [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) API key for cloud AI |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | ❌ | `http://localhost:11434` | Ollama server URL for local AI |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | ❌ | `llama3.1:8b` | Default Ollama model to use |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | ❌ | `http://localhost:3000` | Frontend URL for redirects |
| `OIDC_ISSUER` | ❌ | - | OIDC provider issuer URL |
| `OIDC_AUTH_URL` | ❌ | - | OIDC authorization endpoint |
| `OIDC_TOKEN_URL` | ❌ | - | OIDC token endpoint |
| `OIDC_USERINFO_URL` | ❌ | - | OIDC userinfo endpoint |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | ❌ | - | OIDC client ID |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | ❌ | - | OIDC client secret |
| `OIDC_CALLBACK_URL` | ❌ | `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` | OIDC callback URL |
| `DISABLE_AUTH` | ❌ | `false` | Set to `true` to completely disable authentication (Single User Mode). **WARNING: Bypasses all login security.** |

*If `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is not set, the first user to register will become admin.

### Single User Mode (Disable Authentication)

You can set `DISABLE_AUTH=true` in your `.env` file to bypass the login screen. This enables "Single User Mode", where the default user has full admin privileges automatically.

**Recommended Scenarios:**
1. **Private Local Network**: Hosting on a secure home server (e.g., Unraid, Raspberry Pi) accessible only by you.
2. **Reverse Proxy Auth**: Using a service like Authelia or Authentik upstream to handle security, avoiding a "double login".
3. **Kiosk / Dashboard**: Displaying the app permanently on a wall-mounted tablet or smart display.

> **⚠️ Security Warning**: Never enable this if your instance is exposed directly to the public internet.

### Cloud AI (OpenRouter)

Use cloud-based AI models via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai):

1. Get a free API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Add it to your `.env` file: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...`
3. Restart the container

### Local AI (Ollama) - Privacy-First Option

For complete privacy, OptiStack supports local AI via [Ollama](https://ollama.ai). All AI processing happens on your machine—no data leaves your network.

1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.ai
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
3. Set environment variables in `.env`:
   ```
   AI_PROVIDER=ollama
   OLLAMA_URL=http://localhost:11434
   OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b
   ```
4. Restart the container

**Recommended Ollama Models:**
- `llama3.1:8b` - Good balance of speed and quality
- `mistral:7b` - Fast responses
- `gemma2:9b` - Google's open model

> **Note:** When running OptiStack in Docker, use `OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434` to connect to Ollama running on your host machine.

If no AI provider is configured, the AI sections are completely hidden from the UI.

## Mobile & PWA Support

OptiStack is designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices:
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to all screen sizes with a mobile-first approach.
- **iOS PWA Ready**: Includes a `webmanifest`, standard Apple meta tags, and high-resolution icons for a native-like experience when added to the home screen.
- **Safe Area Support**: Automatically handles notches and home indicators on modern iOS devices.
